💡 My Hackathon Journey

This project was made in just half a day during a hackathon — a quick, on-spot problem-solving challenge.
It was a fun experience where I focused on impact over perfection and learned a lot about building under pressure.

💉 LifeLink

LifeLink is a simple and meaningful web platform I built in just half a day during my hackathon. The goal was to solve a real-life problem — connecting blood donors with people in need quickly and easily.


🌟 About the Project

LifeLink helps users find and connect with nearby blood donors. The idea came from real-life challenges faced during medical emergencies when finding a donor takes too long.
I wanted to create something that could make that process faster, easier, and more accessible.
